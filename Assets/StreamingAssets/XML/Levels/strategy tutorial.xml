    <Wave type="Swarm"    budget ="1500" time="15" message="Lets look at some slightly more advanced strategy.  In this example, your defenses are already strong enough to defeat the enemy.  However, your hand consists of nothing but Basic Towers and Heavy upgrades.  You should play at least one of these so you can draw something more useful for the next wave.  Be careful, though!  Heavy upgrades slow down towers in exchange for doubling their damage.  DO NOT play these on your fast towers: they will actually become weaker since the speed penalty will outweigh the damage buff." />
    <Wave type="Tank"     budget ="1500" time="15" message="Oh no!  This next wave will be Tank monsters, which your fast towers are ill-equipped to handle.  If you followed our advice in the last round, you should draw a Summon Swarm card.  This card will harm you, but not nearly as much as the incoming tanks will.  Play Summon Swarm to turn the incoming wave into Swarm monsters so you can survive" />
    <Wave type="Standard" budget ="1500" time="15" message="You should be able to handle this wave fine, but you have another problem: your towers have only one wave left on them, but there are two more waves to fend off.  You can always build more towers, but there is a better way: play reinforce so that you can keep the ones you have a little longer.  Not only is this cheaper, but it allows you to retain any upgrades your towers may already have.  " />
    <Wave type="Standard" budget ="2000" time="15" message="This wave is tough, but not insurmountable.  Feel free to play your entire hand: there are no more waves after this, and returning the cards you are holding to the deck will help protect you in case some of the enemies break through your defenses." />

		This means you must list the segments in order, and the path can combine but not really branch off because all enemies will take the same path.-->
