		string name: The name of the enemy.  If an enemy of this name already exists, the existing enemy is OVERWRITTEN!
		byte   spawnCost: the wave spawner must "pay" this much to spawn an enemy of this type.  Player receives this much mana when the enemy is killed, and loses twice this much if the enemy reaches the end.
		short  maxHealth: the amount of damage this unit can take before dying.
		byte   damage: the amount of charges removed from the player's deck when this enemy reaches their goal
		byte   unitSpeed: how fast this unit moves
		unitColor: the enemy sprite is colorized with this.  Values range from 0 to 1.-->
