	<!--	for spells, you provide a list of effects applied by the card.  The listed effects determine how the card must be cast,
			for example, if a spell affects a tower, the player will have to select a tower in order to play the card.
			The list of effects is hard coded, but you can combine them in whatever way you wish.  strength has a different meaning for each effect
			Currently, the engine supports:
			drawCard: player draws strength cards
			budgetPercentageChange: multiplies the wave budget by 1.0 + strength.  For example, a strength of 0.5 results in about 50% more enemies
			
			If you want to use an effect not on this list, please suggest it to the developer.-->
