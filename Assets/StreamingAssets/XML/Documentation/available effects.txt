<<these are the available effects and what they do.  X is the effect strength.  Y is the effect argument>>

<<Enemy Effects (Periodic)>>
regeneration | enemy recovers X health per second.  
poison       | enemy takes X damage per second for Y seconds

<<Enemy Effects (Stat Scaling)>>
fixedSpawnCount           | waves of this enemy type always spawn exactly X enemies.  Best when used with budget scaling effects, so stronger waves can continue getting stronger.
invScaleAttackWithDamage  | enemy deals less damage as it gets injured.  Decreases proportionally if x = 1.  Higher/lower values cause it to decrease faster/slower, respectively.
invScaleEffectWithDamage  | target enemy effect weakens as it takes damage.  Decreases proportionally if x = 1.  Higher/lower values cause it to decrease faster/slower, respectively.
invScaleEffectWithTime    | target enemy effect weakens by x/s.  
invScaleSpeedWithDamage   | enemy slows down (to 1) as it takes damage.  Decreases proportionally if x = 1.  Higher/lower values cause it to decrease faster/slower, respectively.
invScaleSpedWithTime      | enemy slows down by x/s (min 1)
scaleAttackhWithBudget    | enemy attack scales up with wave budget.  Increases proportionally if x = 1.  Higher/lower values cause it to increase faster/slower, respectively.
scaleAttackWithDamage     | monster deals more damage as it gets injured.  Increases proportionally if x = 1.  Higher/lower values cause it to increase faster/slower, respectively.
scaleEffectWithBudget     | target enemy effect scales up with wave budget.  Increases proportionally if x = 1.  Higher/lower values cause it to increase faster/slower, respectively.
scaleEffectWithDamage     | target enemy effect scales up as the enemy takes damage.  Increases proportionally if x = 1.  Higher/lower values cause it to increase faster/slower, respectively.
scaleEffectWithRank       | target enemy effect scales up with the rank of the wave (multiplied by X per rank, like how stats scale)
scaleEffectWithTime       | target enemy effect gets stronger by X/s
scaleHealthWithBudget     | enemy health scales up with wave budget.  Increases proportionally if x = 1.  Higher/lower values cause it to increase faster/slower, respectively.
scaleSpeedWithBudget      | enemy speed  scales up with wave budget.  Increases proportionally if x = 1.  Higher/lower values cause it to increase faster/slower, respectively.
scaleSpeedWithDamage      | enemy gets faster as it takes damage.  Increases proportionally if x = 1.  Higher/lower values cause it to increase faster/slower, respectively.
scaleSpeedWithTime        | enemy gets faster by X/s.  Note that there is a global speed limit for all enemies that this will not exceed.
