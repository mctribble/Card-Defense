      string name:      The name of the enemy.  If an enemy of this name already exists, the existing enemy is OVERWRITTEN!
      byte   spawnCost: the wave spawner must "pay" this much to spawn an enemy of this type.
      short  maxHealth: the amount of damage this unit can take before dying.
      byte   damage:    the amount of charges removed from the player's deck when this enemy reaches their goal
      byte   unitSpeed: how fast this unit moves-->

        string rankUpSpawnCount: if the wave would spawn more enemies than this, it ranks up
        float  spawnCostMult:    spawnCost is multiplied by this much every time the wave ranks up.  (in this case, spawn cost will be 2x normal at rank II, 4x normal at rank III, etc.)
        float  attackMult:       attack    is multiplied by this much every time the wave ranks up.
        float  maxHealthMult:    maxHealth is multiplied by this much every time the wave ranks up.
        float  unitSpeedMult:    unitSpeed is multiplied by this much every time the wave ranks up.  Note that base game enemies do not actually use this, and there is a global speed limit in place to prevent enemies outrunning bullets.-->
