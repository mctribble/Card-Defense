		note that the pathfinder is very basic at the moment: at each step it finds all segments that start at the current position and takes one at random.
    if it cant find any segments to take, it treats that as the "end of the road" and the enemy will damage the player when they reach that point.
    This means you must be careful not to allow the path to loop back on itself. or travel away from the intended goal-->
